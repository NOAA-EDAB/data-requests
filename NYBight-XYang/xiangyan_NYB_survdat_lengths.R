# get survey estimated for NYbight strata by length
# provided survdat information for the New York Bight to Xiangyan Yang at Stony
#Brook back in April. The info is here:
#  https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/data-requests/tree/main/NYBight-XYang
# She was updating me on her progress last week and wanted to know if it
# would be possible to get the same survey data but with length compositions.
# She is using this to parameterize an OSMOSE model for the New York Bight.
# Obviously I no longer have access to run this, but the main difference would
# be running this code with getLengths = T at line 13
# https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/data-requests/blob/main/NYBight-XYang/xiangyan_NYB_survdat.R
#The object coming out of that would have lengths.
# I think she ultimately wants catch at length from the survey.
# I donâ€™t see a function for this in the survdat package but it would likely
# look a lot like the catch expansion to lengths that Andy does in mscatch
#https://noaa-edab.github.io/mscatch/articles/catchExpansion.html.
#But it should be simpler since its survey.
